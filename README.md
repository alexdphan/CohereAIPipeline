# CohereGuard

***A versatile and user-friendly Python API Wrapper Package for seamless integration with the Cohere API, offering text preprocessing, classification, and custom guardrail-like features to enhance and secure your natural language processing workflows.***

- Simplifying the process of making API requests by abstracting away some of the implementation details and adding additional functionality

- Providing a more convenient and intuitive interface for developers to interact with
  Handling errors and exceptions in a more user-friendly way

- Additional functionality on top of the API includes things such as preprocessing, rate limiting, or data validation

- Trying to enforce best practices and standards in API usage

_Warning: This is still in development. Use at your own risk!_

**All endpoints integrated with [Guardrails](https://github.com/ShreyaR/guardrails)**

/generate

/classify

/detokenize

/detect-language

/summarize

**More Soon!**

Possible to-do:

- [ ] Create Endpoints

- [ ] Create additional endpoints (optional): Depending on your use case, you may want to create additional FastAPI endpoints for specific validation tasks, such as validating generated content based on classification results or using a different set of rules.

- [ ] Error handling and logging: Implement error handling to manage any issues that might arise during runtime, such as failed API calls or invalid input data. Set up logging to keep track of successful and failed requests, validation errors, and any other relevant information.

- [ ] Testing: Thoroughly test your updated API to ensure that it works as expected, handles various edge cases, and properly applies the Guardrail-like features. Provide examples in examples folder.
